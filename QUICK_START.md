## For Technical Teams

### Test Your Document Processing System

**Upload these 5 PDFs and verify your system can:**

✅ **Extract metadata**
- Contract type, parties, dates, values

✅ **Identify critical terms**
- Liability caps, indemnification, payment terms

- Renewal deadlines

✅ **Provide recommendations**
- Specific actions with owners
- Prioritized by risk level

### Expected Results

Your system should identify **45+ non-standard terms** across 5 contracts:

| Contract | Critical Issues | High Issues | Medium Issues |
|----------|----------------|-------------|---------------|

## For Developers

### Regenerate Contracts

```bash
cd ~/contract_documents_demo
python generate_contracts.py
```

### Customize Contracts

Edit `generate_contracts.py` to:
- Change contract values
- Add new problematic terms
- Create additional contract types
- Modify company names

Each contract is generated by a separate function:
- `create_contract_1()` - Software license
- `create_contract_2()` - Consulting services
- `create_contract_3()` - Cloud services
- `create_contract_4()` - Equipment purchase
- `create_contract_5()` - Master service agreement

### Add New Contracts

Copy an existing function and modify:

```python
def create_contract_6():
    """Your new contract type"""
    filename = "contract_006_your_type.pdf"
    doc = SimpleDocTemplate(filename, pagesize=letter,
                            rightMargin=72, leftMargin=72,
                            topMargin=72, bottomMargin=18)
    
    Story = []
    styles = getSampleStyleSheet()
    
    # Add your content here
    
    doc.build(Story)
    print(f"✓ Generated {filename}")

# Add to main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_contract_1()
    create_contract_2()
    create_contract_3()
    create_contract_4()
    create_contract_5()
    create_contract_6()  # Your new contract
```
