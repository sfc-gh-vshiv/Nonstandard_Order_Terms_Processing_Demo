- Unusual payment terms and escalation clauses
- Asymmetric liability limitations
- Problematic indemnification provisions
- Data sovereignty and security concerns

- Inadequate warranty coverage
- Mandatory arbitration clauses
- Insurance requirement imbalances

## Audit Team Focus Areas

Each contract highlights issues relevant to finance audit teams:

- **Financial Risk**: Uncapped fees, escalation clauses, termination penalties
- **Operational Risk**: SLA gaps, support limitations, forced upgrades

- **Compliance Risk**: Data sovereignty, breach notification, insurance requirements
- **Strategic Risk**: Long lock-in periods, IP ownership, vendor dependencies

## Customization

To create additional contracts or modify existing ones, edit the `generate_contracts.py` file. Each contract is generated by a separate function that you can customize:

- `create_contract_1()` - Software license
- `create_contract_2()` - Consulting services
- `create_contract_3()` - Cloud services
- `create_contract_4()` - Equipment purchase
- `create_contract_5()` - Master service agreement
